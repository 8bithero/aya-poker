//! AyaPoker is a Rust library for fast poker hand evaluation based on the
//! [OMPEval C++ hand evaluator](https://github.com/zekyll/OMPEval), with
//! support for most popular poker variants.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! - Can be used to rank hands from standard poker, ace-to-five lowball,
//!   deuce-to-seven lowball, six-or-better (short-deck), Omaha, Omaha Hi/Lo,
//!   Badugi or Baduci.
//! - Can evaluate hands with 0 to 7 cards, with the missing cards counting as
//!   the worst possible kickers, allowing for use in stud poker games.
//! - Uses compile-time generated perfect hash function lookup tables for
//!   excellent runtime performance and fast initialization.
//! - Has extensive suite of tests to ensure correct implementation of the hand
//!   ranking rules for each variant.
//!
//! # Flags
//!
//! This crate has the following Cargo features:
//!
//! - `std`: By default, `aya_poker` is a `!#[no_std]` crate, but can be
//!   compiled with the `std` feature in order to allow the initialization of
//!   `Deck`s with system-generated random seeds.
//! - `colored`: Use [`colored`](https://crates.io/crates/colored) to display
//!   cards and hands in color.
//! - `colored-4color`: Same as `colored`, but using a four-color deck.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use std::cmp::Ordering;
//!
//! use aya_poker::{base::*, deck::Deck, poker_rank};
//!
//! const SEED: u64 = 42;
//! const SAMPLE_SIZE: usize = 100_000;
//!
//! fn main() -> Result<(), ParseError> {
//!     // We can initialize cards by specifying the rank and suit,
//!     // and then use collect to combine the cards into a Hand
//!     let player = [
//!         Card::new(Rank::King, Suit::Hearts),
//!         Card::new(Rank::King, Suit::Clubs),
//!     ]
//!     .iter()
//!     .collect();
//!
//!     // Or, first parse the cards from strings
//!     let opponent = ["Js".parse::<Card>(), "Qs".parse::<Card>()]
//!         .iter()
//!         .copied()
//!         .collect::<Result<Hand, ParseError>>()?;
//!
//!     // Or, parse a space-separated string of cards as a Hand
//!     let board = "Ah 5s Ts".parse()?;
//!
//!     let equity = equity_calculator(&player, &opponent, &board);
//!     println!(
//!         "{} has {:.1}% equity on {} against {}.",
//!         player,
//!         100.0 * equity,
//!         board,
//!         opponent
//!     );
//!
//!     Ok(())
//! }
//!
//! fn equity_calculator(
//!     player: &Hand,
//!     opponent: &Hand,
//!     board: &Hand,

//!     // that doesn't contain the already dealt-out cards

//!         deck.reset();

//!         let opponent_rank = poker_rank(&opponent_hand);
//!
//!         // And record the player's share of the pot for the run
//!         match player_rank.cmp(&opponent_rank) {
//!             Ordering::Greater => pots_won += 1.0,
//!             Ordering::Less => {}
